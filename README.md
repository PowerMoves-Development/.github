Welcome to **PowerMoves Development**, the dedicated FiveM script division of PowerMoves Gaming.

Our mission is to elevate FiveM roleplay through innovative, high-performance **Lua scripts**. While our primary development focus is on the **qb-core framework**, we're committed to maximizing accessibility by also providing robust support for **qbx_core** and **ESX**. We uniquely leverage deep insights gained from **years of active roleplay experience** to craft solutions that directly address common pain points and unlock new, immersive scenarios.

We focus on:
* **Multi-Framework Compatibility:** Delivering versatile scripts that work across leading FiveM frameworks.
* **Robust & Optimized Code:** Ensuring reliable and efficient scripts for seamless server operation.
* **Roleplay-Centric Features:** Creating functionalities that genuinely enhance player interaction and story development.

Explore our repositories to see how we're pushing the boundaries of FiveM roleplay.
